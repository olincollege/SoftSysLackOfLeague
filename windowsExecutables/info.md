## Basic Info

The file we are trying to delete is `RiotClientServices.exe`, it is the exeuable file that opens all riot games. We need to delete this file because this program is capable of redownloading files necessary for League of Legends to function. This file is usually stored at the file path `C:\Riot Games\Riot Client`. To speed up finding the full file path, we can run `deleteKeyFiles.exe` with the above file path to start. If it is in the default location, it should find and delete the file in no time. If the game is stored in an alternate location on the computer, you can run the program using `C:` which will take much longer but will almost certainly find and delete the file. I chose to make the program take parameters so that it could be used for different files and different games. This freedom does however allow the program to be used to delete files essential to the operating system. DO NOT run this program and try to delete system32.
